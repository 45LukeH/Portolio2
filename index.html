           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Learning through experimentation was a big creative habit I pulled out of these projects. Although I have no prior knowledge or skills in HTML code, I was able to create these websites by experimenting with different tools offered by style.css. Much of my experimentation came with trial and error. There were many errors, but as my professor says, "If you're going to fail, fail fast." I learned from my failures, and finally getting something right after failing again and again is a rewarding experience.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">While I am not the most social person, workshopping with others proves time and time again that it is beneficial for me. Not only do I get to share my ideas with others, but I get to listen to others' ideas. Getting different perspectives on the same projects is very beneficial for me since I have a very linear way of thinking. Overall, workshopping with others is great for getting some new ideas, perspectives, or just learning something from a peer that I had no idea how to do before that engagement.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">As a craftsman, it is important to me that, not just I, but others can enjoy and appreciate my work. While, as I mentioned before, I am not great with working on HTML code, I did my best to make my pages look clean and consistent. Experimenting with image sizes, borders, text boxes, and buttons has stapled the idea of craft into my mind by making sure the websites look good and make sense to me, my peers, and even outside viewers. Playing around has also taught me that their is no "perfect" way to craft something.</p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Consistently working with HTML code and reading our class readings has created bridges in my brain that I never thought I would connect. The saying "consistency is key" could not be any better for this class. At first, I had very little knowledge about manipulating code. However, now that we have been doing it for a few weeks, I feel ready to tackle many problems within my HTML code that I would not have been able to do just a month earlier.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">As I said earlier, I am not the most social person. This class has helped me break out of that shell a bit. In week 2, we presented our first project to the class. Although I felt nervous at first, I did not afterwards. This was a great learning experience to show that there is truly nothing to worry about when I'm in a positive learning environment. On top of that, presenting in small groups has helped me both answer and ask questions about my own projects and peer projects.</p>

        <h3>Photo Essay</h3>
          <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="https://youtu.be/2iiaQ3n80i8">
         <div class="hover">
       <img src="Making4.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"alt="Image" >
              </div>
     </a>
        <p>This project was my first time working with Adobe Premiere Pro. While I was not a pro with the software at the time (and still am not), I enjoyed learning the new tools I could incorporate to edit my own videos together.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>B-Roll Challenge</h3>
          <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="https://youtu.be/qDstwti-IPg">
         <div class="hover">
       <img src="Making5.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"alt="Image" >
              </div>
     </a>
        <p>This was my second time working with Adobe Premiere Pro. Our assignment was to compile B-Roll film, so I decided to add a mixture of B-Roll from my real life and B-Roll from videos about retro video games to create a narrative of going back in time to my childhood and playing these games again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>The Interview</h3>
         <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="https://youtu.be/rsRcKSlGAM4">
        <div class="hover">
      <img src="Making6.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"alt="Image" >
             </div>
    </a>
       <p>This was one of my favorite projects to work on so far. I needed to interview somebody who had knowledge about old sports video games, and there was no better person for this task than my dad. I enjoyed the pre-interview work of getting the lighting right, making sure the audio worked, and setting up the scenery. I then of course loved talking to my dad about the games he grew up playing. Finally, I edited the product in Premiere Pro to give it a sleek, professional finish.</p>
   </div>
      </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Premiere Pro Special Effects</h3>
          <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="https://youtu.be/lLl0xZwSpq0">
         <div class="hover">
       <img src="Making7.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"alt="Image" >
              </div>
     </a>
        <p>This assignment was fun because I got to experiment with some of many effects in Premiere Pro that I was not able to explore before. The YouTube tutorials helped guide me in the right direction to give my text the glitching effect that I wanted, since my final project will cover retro video games.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Adobe After Effect Animation</h3>
          <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="https://youtu.be/jUL9nv9zRCY">
         <div class="hover">
       <img src="Making8.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"alt="Image" >
              </div>
     </a>
        <p>While this assignment was similar to the one before, the learning curve was wildly different. This was my first time working with after effects, so I needed to follow online tutorials closely in order to give my text the effect of turning at the beginning and then switching colors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>Adobe Character Creator</h3>
         <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="https://youtu.be/o4ndK8KTDuM">
        <div class="hover">
      <img src="Making9.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"alt="Image" >
             </div>
    </a>
       <p>At first I was hesitant to start this assignment since I have no prior experience with character animation. However, after using Adobe Character Animator, it could not have been more helpful and straightforward. The fact that my computer was able to easily scan my face and give the robot facial expressions was astonishing to me. Then, after the recording, I was able to implement body movements to the robot that matched with what I was talking about.</p>

       <div class="container-fluid bg-b text-center">
     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Just like in phase 1 of this portfolio, I learned a great deal about the various Adobe softwares we used through experimenting and playing. Both in-class and YouTube tutorials gave me the foundation I needed to complete video projects that I was proud of. While I am no expert with the Adobe softwares, I feel that these projects gave me enough knowledge to tackle more projects like these in the future, and add even more into them!</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">While I did not do a ton of "working" with my peers during these assignments, we did do a great deal of talking about our final projects. During this time, I learned a great deal about my other classmates through their thinking process. While talking with them, it even sparked some new ideas in my mind for various things I could incorporate in my final project. Working with my dad during the interview was a treat since I enjoy talking with him about his childhood and what he enjoyed doing. Even though it was my dad, I was still nervous to conduct an interview in front of bright lights and a microphone, but, in the end, we both  enjoyed the process.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Working with film has taught me a ton about the actual craft of film making. My favorite film to make was probably the B-Roll challenge, since I got to experiment with different mediums of video while trying to tell a story. I used video from my everyday life, timelapses of car rides I took, YouTube videos of retro video games, and some home video that is probably around 17 years old at this point. I know that I could not make every project "perfect," but I did my best to emulate perfection by making sure my audio was matched correctly, scene transitions were used properly, lighting was ample (when needed), and animations were experimented with.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Working with Premiere Pro was a learning curve to say the least, but using it consistently has allowed me to gain the skills necessary to work comfortably within the software. Also, working with synergetic softwares to Premiere Pro like Adobe Audition, Character Creator, Lightroom Classic, and After Effects allows me to create more complex works that I wouldn't have been able to a month and a half ago. Since Photoshop was the only Adobe software I was familiar with prior to this class, I am happy to say that I have added many more Adobe skills to that arsenal. </p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I have been using YouTube since I can remember, but I have never uploaded a YouTube video before these units. As a mostly introverted individual, this was uncomfortable at first until I realized that we're all just amateur college students creating for the first time together. Now, though, I am comfortable releasing videos to the world, and not just the class (as long as my face isn't in it). I have learned that making is a process, but a fun process that should be shared with others where applicable.</p>
